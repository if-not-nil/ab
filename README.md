# a-b vm
a stack-based VM in C. i'm trying to leave coherent comments throughout, so it should be easy to read

c++ would probably work better but i wanna learn C

for compile instructions look through the makefile. you may want to change your compiler

milestones:\
    - [ ] assembly:\
        + [x] all the instructions\
        + [ ] labels\
        + [ ] macros\
        + [ ] strings\
    - [ ] variables\
    - [ ] functions\
    - [ ] jit language (end goal)
